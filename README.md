# Image Player #

Image Player is a JavaScript app to view collections of images on a web pages.
The original purpose of this script was to play a collection of images as if
they were a video, flipbook style. Support for multiple 'videos' which can be
selected from a menu is also available.

### Drawbacks ###

I would not recommend actually using this script as it is incredibly bandwidth
heavy. It is much better to just use a GIF, which at least does some
compression.

### Dependencies ###

* jQuery 1.4 or greater.

### Example ###

I originally wrote this for my fathers website. You can see it being used here:
